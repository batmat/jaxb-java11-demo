= Jenkins setup demonstrating the JAXB API plugin usage on Java 11

Starting with Java 9+, JAXB is not available anymore by default in the JDK.

This Jenkins Docker image demonstrates that the https://github.com/jenkinsci/jaxb-plugin/ allows to fix the `ClassNotFoundException` we would normally encounter.

== Use this image

* Build it as usual

```
docker build -t jaxb-java11-demo .
```

* Run it on Java 11

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -ti jaxb-java11-demo
```

* Open the browser on http://localhost:8080
* Login as admin:admin
* Start the count-loc job
* See it succeeds, despite running on Java 11 without any java 11 specific flag (i.e. no `--add-modules`)

=== To run it on Java 8

```
docker run -e JAVA8=yes -p 8080:8080 -ti jaxb-java11-demo
```
